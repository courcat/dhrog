# Announcement
Courcat has continued development of Dhrog but has decided to redesign the game from the ground up with online multiplayer as the focus and in a manner that puts security as a high priority. In order to do so, the team has decided not to publish the code as open source. We will make sure to include a way to mod the game, but will do so without comprimising the game security and not allowing players to cheat using mods or hacks. 

This version is still around and will be left up incase anyone wants to experiment with the code. Please feel free to do so.

Thank you for your understanding,

Josh Grift,<br>
Dhrog Development Head
